FOUNDATIONS CAPSTONE PLAN: PokeLF

The end goal (though i dont plan to have this all done for the project)
to make a webapp that will allow people to log and keep track of the 
pokemon that they own, including info such as species nickname, stats,
whether or not its shiny, ball it is held in, gender, moves, etc
and eventually to be able to mark whether or not a pokemon is up for trade, 
and also for said person to have a wishlist of pokemon they are in search of
and to match people to other peopl based on their pokemon for trade and their wishlist
